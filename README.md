## Build/Compile

You just need to open `index.html` in your browser of choice.

## Notes

In case you want to play around with the code, the only thing you need is 
globally installed typescript's compiler.

You can run: 
```console
> tsc -w
```
in project's main directory.

You can then change `main.ts` however you like, the compiler will update the corresponding `main.js` file
after every change/save.
